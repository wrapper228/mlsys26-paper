\section{Embedding-Norm Is Monotonic in Item Popularity}
\label{sec:norm-monotonicity}

Throughout this section (as well as corresponding appendices) we assume the four conditions from Section~2 hold (SGD without momentum/regularization; parameter-linear encoder; lookup-equivalent encoder; cosine-loss gradient orthogonal to the output). Under these assumptions the embedding moves orthogonally at each update. By the Pythagorean theorem,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pythagoras-increment}
\bigl\|q_i^{(t+1)}\bigr\|^{2} - \bigl\|q_i^{(t)}\bigr\|^{2} \;=\; \bigl\|\Delta q_i^{(t)}\bigr\|^{2}.
\end{equation}

Finally, we analyze the dependence of the embedding-norm growth on item popularity. Appendix~\ref{app:popularity-dependence} formalizes a clean coupling \emph{mechanism} that isolates the effect of sampling probability and proves that, conditional on per-update increments, the expected \emph{squared} norm after $T$ batches is nondecreasing in the item's sampling probability.

\paragraph{Takeaway.} This section and Appendix~\ref{app:popularity-dependence} provide a formal mechanism for popularity bias: under the four assumptions of Section~2, each update contributes a nonnegative radial increment to $\|q_i\|^2$, and more frequent sampling increases how often those increments are accumulated.
To observe a statistically significant popularity bias in practice, an additional (fifth) factor is required; it will be discussed in the next section.
