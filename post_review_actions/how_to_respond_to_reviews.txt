Dear author,

The author response period will begin next Monday (1/12), and you will
have until next Friday (1/16) AOE to submit your response. In
preparation, we would like to share a set of instructions and advice,
adapted from guidance developed by Derek Dreyer and Zach Tatlock. Please
read this email carefully, as it contains important information and
guidelines for the response process.

1. **Stay anonymous**

MLSys uses a double-blind review process, so reviewers do not know the
authors’ identities. Please do not, under any circumstances, reveal your
identity in your author response. For industry track submissions,
authors may include company names and product names in the response, but
should not reveal author names. If you believe there is a compelling
reason to disclose identifying information, please contact the PC chairs
by email before doing so.

2. **Word limit**

Author responses may be up to 2000 words. Shorter, more focused
responses are often more effective, while responses exceeding 2000 words
are not permitted.

3. **Submitting a response is strongly recommended**

Submitting an author response is optional but strongly encouraged. The
response provides an opportunity to clarify misunderstandings, address
reviewers’ concerns, and help reviewers better assess your work. Not
submitting a response may signal to reviewers that you do not wish to
engage with their feedback.

4. ** Finalize your response before submitting**

Note that HotCRP emails your response to reviewers as soon as you submit
it. As a result, reviewers may start reading your response immediately,
even before the response deadline. We therefore recommend finalizing
your response text before submitting it. While you may re-submit your
response if needed, each resubmission will generate an additional email
notification to reviewers.

5. ** Additional reviews**

A very small number of reviews are still outstanding. As a result, some
papers may receive additional reviews during or after the author
response period. The PC will take into account that authors did not have
an opportunity to respond to such reviews during deliberations.

6. **Structure of the response**

The author response serves two primary purposes: (1) to correct factual
errors or points of confusion in the reviews, and (2) to convince
reviewers that you have a concrete, feasible plan to revise the paper to
address their criticisms within the approximately two months between
notification of conditional acceptance and the camera-ready deadline.

To this end, you may consider the following structure for your response:

- OPENING: Begin your response by thanking the reviewers. They invested
substantial effort—many during the holiday period—to produce more than
1,600 reviews for MLSys.

- OVERVIEW: A brief overview of the key points of your response. You may
highlight major factual errors in the reviews, acknowledge major
criticisms (especially those raised by multiple reviewers), and briefly
explain how you plan to address them. Avoid being defensive; for
example, if reviewers found part of the paper unclear, acknowledge this
and describe how you will improve the presentation.

- CHANGE LIST: A concise, bulleted list of the major, concrete changes
you plan to make to address the reviewers' criticisms. This list should
align with the issues discussed in the overview and demonstrate that you
have a clear and executable revision plan.

- DETAILED RESPONSE: A reviewer-by-reviewer list of responses to
substantive questions and comments. While it is not necessary to address
every minor point, it is generally helpful to respond to the most
significant concerns.

We hope the author response allows the PC to give full consideration to
each submission and ultimately strengthens the quality and depth of the
MLSys 2026 program.
