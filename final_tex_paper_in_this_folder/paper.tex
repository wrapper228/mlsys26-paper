\begin{abstract}
Two-tower models trained with cosine-based objectives are widely used in retrieval, yet we observe a systematic growth of item embedding norms that correlates with item popularity. Building on a first-order analysis of SGD updates, we identify architectural and optimization conditions under which the update to an embedding deviates from the cosine-gradient direction and accumulates components that increase its norm. We provide a simple unifying formula that explains when norm growth emerges, and discuss its implications for ranking when dot-product scoring is used. We outline practical mitigations, including architectural choices, explicit normalization, and alternative scoring strategies. Our analysis frames popularity-driven norm growth as an optimization artifact rather than a purely data-driven effect, guiding principled remedies for large-scale retrieval systems.
