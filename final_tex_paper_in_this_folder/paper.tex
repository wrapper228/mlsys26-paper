\begin{abstract}
We present observations and analysis of embedding norm growth in two-tower models trained with cosine-based objectives. We outline hypotheses, empirical evidence, and implications for retrieval quality, and discuss mitigation strategies.

\section{Background}
We briefly review contrastive training with in-batch negatives (e.g., InfoNCE / full softmax) and cosine similarity objectives.

\section{Analysis of norm growth}
We formalize the conditions under which embedding norms can encode popularity bias despite cosine normalization at scoring time.

\section{Mitigations}
We outline practical strategies and trade-offs.

\section{Conclusion}
We summarize findings and highlight open questions.
