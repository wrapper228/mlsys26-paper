\section{Experiments: Empirical Validation of Theoretical Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

To clarify scope, we do not assess recommendation quality on held-out datasets and we do not report relevance metrics (e.g., MAP@k). 
Instead, we empirically examine geometric properties of the training dynamics across encoder architectures and training designs, focusing on the orthogonality of embedding updates and the frequencyâ€“norm coupling predicted by the theory.
