\section{Note on batch difference}
\label{app:note-on-batch-difference}

In the coupled runs described above, the collected batches may differ in the slots where $p'_i < U < p''_i$. Therefore, in a situation where item $i$ appears in both collected batches, it may happen that $c'' < c'$. For example, the run with $p''_i$ could have included both positive and negative interactions with item $i$, whereas the run with $p'_i$ happened to include only positive interactions with $i$.

However, the mere event $c'' < c'$ is not enough to reverse the order $s'' \ge s'$. To flip the inequality for the accumulated sums one would need a very large difference $c'' \ll c'$, which is a low-probability event. See Appendix~\ref{app:note-on-c-variability} (“$\|u_{t+1}\| \gg \|u_t\|$ is a rare event”).
